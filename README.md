### What I learned

I have, for a first time, worked with <pre> so I could see how it behaves:

```html
          <pre>
Tutorials by industry experts
Peer &amp; expert code review
Coding exercises
Access to our GitHub repos
Community forum
Flashcard decks
New videos every week</pre>
```

I have also worked with mobile verison and @media screen for a first time:

```css
/* mobile version */
@media screen and (max-width: 376px){
    body{
        width: 100%;
        height: auto;
    }
    main{
        display: flex;
        flex-wrap: wrap;
        margin: 72px 32px 75px;
        height: auto;
    }
    section{
        width:100%;
        height: auto;
        padding:30px;
    }
}
```

### Useful resources
